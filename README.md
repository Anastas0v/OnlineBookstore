## Technology I Used

**As a Java Engineer with a main focus on the Spring Framework**, Spring Boot was a natural choice. It allows me to build and deliver clean, scalable, and robust applications. The Spring ecosystem (Spring Data, Spring Web, etc.) takes care of most infrastructure concerns, so I can focus on the core domain logic.

**Technologies Information:**
1. Java 21 – I went with the latest Java version to take advantage of modern features and solid performance.
2. Spring Boot 3.4.* – It’s my go-to for building backend apps quickly and cleanly, with everything I need already built in.
3. Spring Data JPA – Makes working with the database super easy by handling most of the heavy things when it comes to data access.
4. Lombok – Helps keep the code clean by cutting down on repetitive stuff like getters, setters, and constructors.
5. H2 Database – Perfect for development and testing. Works out of the box.
